[h1]No Congestion On Conveyors[/h1]
[h3]Description[/h3]
Do you want to make the conveyors a bit more effective without making them feel overpowered?
Then this mod is for you!

This mod simply removes the congestion speed penalty on conveyors (but only on conveyors, corridors and other parts remain unchanged).
So, when a lot of crew members walk on the conveyors, they won't be slowed down by each others.
However, the conveyor speed stays the same, ensuring they don't become overpowered.

[h3]Game Version[/h3]
The mod is updated for the game version "0.27.xx".
Note : In the future, when the game will update to the version 0.28.xx for example, if the game say this mod is outdated, activate it anyway. There is 99% chance it still works fine for future game version.

[h3]Removing The MOD[/h3]
This mod just change some parts settings that is not stored in your saves. So it can be removed safely at any time without any risk to broke your saves :)
